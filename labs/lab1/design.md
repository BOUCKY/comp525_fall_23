Create a  DESIGN.md file and use Markdown notation to reflect on your whole experience.
Upon completion of each of the three increments of the project development, share your thoughts about the following:
What programming concepts and techniques were completely new to you? 
Were there roadblocks or issues you needed to spend more time or seek help with? How did you overcome those? 
What aspect are you interested in learning more about or becoming more proficient with?
Conclude your reflection with thoughts about the overall experience: 
How long did it take? Did you do it all at once or you spaced it out?
How did the collaboration go? 
Think of one lesson learned about yourself as a learner and/or computing professional
